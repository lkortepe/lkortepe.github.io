	<p>Bio 1 - The Lost Post Doc</p>
	<p>Field of study: Average Biology, for organisms that are neither macro nor micro</p>
	<p>Home Town: Tarzana, California (an LA suburb)</p>
	<p>Details: The Lost Post Doc is currently in the second year of their third post doc. He "works" in the <a href="https://www.library.jhu.edu/staff/heather-tapager/">Tapager Lab</a>.
	Current focus is on how stress levels of average size organisms fluctuate after interactions with different types of carpet. Ex: do cats prefer long soft carpet or short hard carpet?</p>
	<p>Fun fact: Really likes ending sentences with "heyo!"
